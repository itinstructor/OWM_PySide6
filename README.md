# OpenWeatherMap Python PySide6 GUI Program
OpenWeatherMap Python GUI Program with PySide6
### Overview
- Python PySide6 GUI program using requests, OpenWeatherMap API, OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API, and Nominatim from geopy.
- Includes current weather and AQI (Air Quality Index).
- The ui was built (and a lot of time was saved) using QT Designer.
- Air Quality Index is a separate API call from OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API.
- The lat and long retrieved from OpenWeatherMap is reverse geocoded into the name of the location using Nominatim from geopy.
    * The reverse geocoding from geopy confirms that we have the weather for the right city.
- JSON sample response files used to build the program are in the json_response_files folder.
- A batch file is included for nuitka building to a Windows exe (nuitka_gui.bat)
    * Install nuitka: pip install nuitka
